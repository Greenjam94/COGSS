#COGSS 2.0

#What is COGSS
COGSS stands for Collegiate Online Gymnastics Scoring System. It will be a web app that makes scoring meets as easy as
inputing scores. The site manages the rest for you, making it very easy to host a meet of any size.

## Tasks
This kanban board is open to the public to see, because I need a lot of help with Node JS and Angular. This project
needs to be completed by the end of February.
